#Education

## Self-training
Each developer will have to learn the basics of both JS and HTML on its own.
Such training should take around 3-5 days of work according to the expertise of the developer.
We have the following online training that can help us to achieve this goal:
* Basic training (video based) for beginners: http://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Javascript-Fundamentals-Development-for-Absolute-Beginners
* Interactive online training for JS: http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript-combined
* Interactive online training for HTML & CSS http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/htmlcss, http://htmldog.com/ and http://www.html5rocks.com/en/
* *“JavaScript. The Core.”* http://dmitrysoshnikov.com/ecmascript/javascript-the-core/ very deep tutorial on JS core concepts: Object, Prototype Chain, Scope, Functions, Closures, Execution Context Stack, etc. Read it to get fluent with JS as programming language.
